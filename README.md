This project is an interactive Streamlit dashboard designed for exploring artifacts metadata and media information using 25 pre-defined SQL queries.
The app connects to a 
 MySQL-compatible database,
 allowing users to easily view data tables,
 key metrics, 
 and visualizations. 
It features an interactive sidebar for selecting queries, a metrics panel that displays the number of rows, columns, and the query number, and tabbed views for a table of results, 
chart visualizations of numeric data, and the SQL query itself. The dashboard is fully compatible with Streamlit and MySQL/TiDB databases, providing a user-friendly interface for
artifact data analysis.
